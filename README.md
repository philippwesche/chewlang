Chew or chewlang is intended to be a high-level programming language and code generator with heavy emphasis on regular expressions and anticipated use in data scraping.

It currently compiles down to Perl5.

Design priorities:
* Short, readable code
* Ease of learning (esp. being incrementally useful)
* Modelled after natural English usage
* Experimental introduction of "contexts" to replace/unify control and parameters
